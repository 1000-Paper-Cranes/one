[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is a [package manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager) for OSX. _Install everything through Homebrew_ and you'll get fewer maddening path and version problems. Just stick with Homebrew!

(I am banned by Devops from using anything other than Homebrew and this is absolutely deserved.)

To install homebrew. In your terminal type:
````
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
````

Then to install anything you need type:
````
brew install packagename
````

Like, for this project you'd need to:

````
brew install node
````

and 

````
brew install ruby
`````

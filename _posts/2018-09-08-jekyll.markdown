<cite>One</cite> uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), one of the oldest and most popular [static site generators](). I use Jekyll a lot for prototyping and a lot of people use it for blogging. You can use it right in Github to make a site if you want.

To run Jekyll you need:
1. a [ruby development environment](/homebrew)
2. the jekyll gem: 
	````
	gem install jekyll bundler
	````
3. a jekyll project:
	````
	jekyll new projectname
	````

Now change directory into your new project:
	````
	cd projectname
	````
And serve your new site:
	````
	jekyll serve
	````

And you're up and going! Add posts to your posts folder, or make a [collection]() of pages if you prefer. And start writing your templates in [liquid](/liquid).

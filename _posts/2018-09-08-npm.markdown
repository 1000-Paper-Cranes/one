To install [Gulp](/gulp) you need NPM (and to use that you need node and to use that you need [Homebrew](/homebrew)!)

[NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) is a [package manager](https://www.npmjs.com/). Another one that does basically the same thing (cue outraged dissent) is [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/), but this site is using npm. 


To check you have node type:
````
node -v
````

And to check you have npm (comes with node):
````
npm -v
````

If you don't have node, install it with [Homebrew](/homebrew) (on Mac).
